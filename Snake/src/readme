Welcome to Snake


To play this game we use
'w' to go up,
'a' to go left,
's' to go down
and 'd' to go right
You must press enter to move the snake.


Your goal will be to eat the more apples you can.
You must no collide with your own body and the walls of the game.

Thanks for playing!
